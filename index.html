<!-- 
  This is the main HTML file for simple static webpage.
  It describes the structure and content of the page.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
  <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
  It helps the browser render the page correctly.

<!-- 
  <html> is the root element of an HTML page.
  lang="en" means the language is English (useful for accessibility and SEO).
-->

<head>
    <!-- 
      <head> contains metadata (data about the page, not visible content).
      Things like the title, character encoding, links to CSS, etc.
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- 
      <meta charset="UTF-8" defines the character encoding.
      UTF-8 supports most characters in all languages, so it’s the standard choice.
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- 
      This meta tag makes the page responsive on mobile devices.
      width=device-width → use the device screen width.
      initial-scale=1.0 → initial zoom is 100%.
    -->

    <title>Simple Static Webpage</title>
    <!-- 
      <title> sets the text shown in the browser tab and in search results.
    -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <!-- 
      This links the external CSS file.
      rel="stylesheet" → it’s a stylesheet.
      href="style.css" → the file is in the same folder as index.html.
    -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- 
      <body> contains everything that will be displayed on the page: text, images, etc.
    -->

    <header>
        <!-- 
          <header> typically contains the main title, logo, or navigation.
          Here we just use it for the page heading.
        -->
        <h1>Welcome to Simple Static Webpage</h1>
        <!-- 
          <h1> is the main heading (highest level heading).
          There should usually be only one <h1> per page.
        -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- 
          <main> wraps the main content of the page.
